Pneumonia Detection Using VGG19
This project demonstrates the use of the VGG19 architecture for pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images. The model classifies images as either pneumonia or normal based on the features learned from a large dataset of chest X-rays.

Tech Stack
Backend: Flask (Python Web Framework)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (VGG19 model for classification)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web interface)
Model Architecture
VGG19 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 19 layers, commonly used for image classification tasks. In this project, VGG19 is fine-tuned to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: pneumonia and normal.
Features
Upload chest X-ray images.
Use a pre-trained VGG19 model (fine-tuned on pneumonia detection) to classify the images.
Display the classification result (Pneumonia or Normal) to the user.
Simple web interface using Flask, with a loading indicator while the model processes the image.
Steps to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection-vgg19.git
cd pneumonia-detection-vgg19
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the pneumonia detection web app.

Model Training (Optional)
If you want to train the VGG19 model from scratch or fine-tune it for pneumonia detection, you can use a chest X-ray dataset like Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) from Kaggle. The model is trained using transfer learning with the VGG19 architecture.

Example Workflow
Upload Image: Upload a chest X-ray image.
Predict: Click "Predict" to classify the image.
Result: The model predicts whether the image shows pneumonia or is normal.
